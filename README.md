# UnitTester
A rack mounted piece of gear for testing chips

#### Why
Always wanted some rack-mount piece of gear based on the DIN 41612 standard. This is slightly modified.
Also, want to test the complete PIC32 toolchain without plugging and replugging the programmer a thousand times.

#### When
Soon.
