- PIC12F615, HV verzija (vsaj 8, SOIC)
- Refill kondenzatorjev

* PIC32MX274F256D (PIC32MX275F256D is not available (with VBAT), MX175 ditto)

* = variants with USB
+ = variants with CAN
Support list
* PIC32MM GPL - done

* PIC32MM GPM - done

* PIC32MX 1/2*/5+
-> PIC32MX 1/2 should be done
-> PIC32MX 5 should be done, was tested with a little gumstix board from mikroelektronika

* PIC32MX 1/2* XLP - NOT DONE, NOT TESTED

* PIC32MX 3/4*
- Should be done, but there are some differences between say 340 and 350.
- Warrants another look

* PIC32MX 5x/6*/7+ (yo wtf) - shold be done
- Series 6&7 weren't tested, 5 should be in the above

* PIC32MK GP/MC
- Work continuing on it. There are differences in chips, but the peripherals are the same
- Differences are dual-banks of flash for example.

* PIC32MZ EF
- Should be working

* PIC32MZ DA
- Never tried, TODO

* PIC32MZ EC
- The abandoned platform. Purely out fo jest we should support it

* PIC32W (EZ in disguise)
- Should make compile just because.

Needed chips are then
MX5, MX6, MX7, MX1/2 XLP, MK?, MZ DA, MZ EC, MZ W.
